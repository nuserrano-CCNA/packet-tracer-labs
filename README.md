## Welcome! 

This repository contains my Cisco Packet Tracer labs, documenting my journey from beginner networking concepts to intermediate and advanced enterprise-level simulations. Each lab includes configuration files, topologies, step-by-step explanations, and lessons learned.

---

## 🟢 Beginner Labs

These labs cover foundational networking concepts such as IP addressing, VLANs, static routing, and basic connectivity.

---

## 🟡 Intermediate Labs

These labs introduce dynamic routing, inter-VLAN routing, NAT/PAT, ACLs, and HSRP failover scenarios.

---

## 🔴 Advanced Labs

Advanced labs simulate enterprise networks with redundancy, QoS, security policies, and monitoring setups.
